# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the [Online Retail dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayuv/onlineretail). By analyzing transaction data, we identify distinct customer groups and create interactive visualizations to present insights about different customer segments.

## Dataset
The Online Retail dataset contains transactions from a UK-based online retail store that specializes in selling unique all-occasion gift-ware. The dataset includes:
- Customer ID
- Invoice date
- Product details
- Quantity
- Price
- Country

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing it for analysis
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing transaction patterns, product popularity, and customer behavior
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics and additional features
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Applying K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms
5. **Visualization**: Creating interactive visualizations to present findings

## Results
The analysis identified 4 distinct customer segments with a silhouette score of 0.68:
- Segment 1: [Description]
- Segment 2: [Description]
- Segment 3: [Description]
- Segment 4: [Description]
